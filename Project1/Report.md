## DQN - Deep Q Learning

Deep Q Learning is a Value based Reinforcement Learning method which uses Neural Networks as a function approximator to approximate the optimal action/state value function for a given environment. As part of the overall model, the Neural Network takes as input states of the environment and uses them to approximate action values for each possible action.
